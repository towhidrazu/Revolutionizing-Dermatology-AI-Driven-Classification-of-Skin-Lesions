# Revolutionizing-Dermatology-AI-Driven-Classification-of-Skin-Lesions
Skin diseases comprise 1.79% of the global burden of disease. Due to the variation in skin tone, texture, body hair, etc., the accurate diagnosis of specific skin diseases is an intriguing task. Skin lesions can vary in diverse conditions, from benign growth to malignant
cancers. Also, these can have varying shapes, sizes, colors, and vague boundaries of some lesions.

Inaccurate or delayed diagnoses can result in critical situations, particularly in melanoma cases. In 2022, it was estimated that approximately 330,000 new cases of melanoma were diagnosed worldwide, with nearly 60,000 resulting in death (World Health Organization, 2022). If untreated this can be potentially lifethreatening. This project therefore seeks to leverage artificial intelligence in crafting an efficient classification system of skin lesions which can aid dermatologists in arriving at early and accurate diagnosis.

The International Skin Imaging Collaborationâ€‹ (ISIC) data is used for this purpose which is publicly available.

There are eight types of skin lesions which we work on. namely

A. Cancerous 
1. Melanoma (MEL)
2. Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)
3. Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)

B. Non-Cancerous

4. Melanocytic Nevus (NV)
5. Actinic Keratosis (precancerous) (AK)
6. Benign Keratosis (BKL)
7. Dermatofibroma (DF)
8. Vascular Lesion (VASC)
